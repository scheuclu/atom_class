This directory contains the two main parts of the "Atomistic Modeling of Materials"-exam of 2017 at TU-Munich.

## [1_three-dimensional_atomic_system](1_three-dimensional_atomic_system)
This Part deals with a three dimensional system of Krypton atoms.
Among others, the following tasks ars conducted:
  - Nose-Hover thermostat, Nose-Hover barostat and weakly-coupled Berendsen algorithm
  - Determination of equilibrium Box sizes
  - Stability considerations
  - Study of different values for the damoing parameter
  - Analysis of the dependence of the results on the system size
  - Comparison of MD with a MCMC approach
  - Dependency of the results variance on the system size
  - Estimation of mass-densitys and comparison with literature values
  - Calculation of the specific heat capacity
  - Simulation of phase transitions

## [2_Two-dimensional_atomic_tensile_test](2_Two-dimensional_atomic_tensile_test)
This part deals with obtaining a macroscopic stress strain relation by simulation a 2D configuration of Krypton atoms.
Among others, the following tasks are conducted:
  - NPT ensemble
  - Analysis of the influence of dampoing parameters on the simulations stability and results
  - Determination of equilibrium results
  - Derivation of the stress-strain relation via simulation
