\chapter{Three-dimensional atomistic system}
For the determination of the lattice constant and lattice type, 3 different configurations are considered:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Face-centered cubic (FCC)
\item Body-centered cubic (BCC)
\item Primitive cubic     (PC)
\end{enumerate}
The system will take those configuration, which shows the least total energy per atom. Since interactions happen not only with the closes neighbors, but also with other atoms, an simulation has to be performed to get the exact energys.\\
However, a good first approximation can be made analytically by considering the following observations: All atoms within a lattice type are equal, meaning that an atom that appears as a center atom in BCC can also be viewed as a corner atom just by shifting the connections. Secondly, if one denoted the length of the cube as lattice constant $a$, one can easily determine the distances between all atom by simple geometric means.\\
By looking only at the closest neighbours, one can derive the following expression for the energy per atom in all 3 grids:
\begin{align}
E_{FCC}&=6 U(a_{FCC})+12 U(a_{FCC}/\sqrt{2}) \\
E_{BCC}&=6 U(a_{BCC})+8 U(a_{BCC} \sqrt{3}/2) \\
E_{PC} &=6 U(a_{PC})
\end{align}

By solving for local minima, the following lattice constants are obtained
\begin{align}
a_{FCC,min}&= 5.7432\AA\\
a_{BCC,min}&= 4.6143\AA\\
a_{PC,min} &= 4.097\AA\\
\end{align}

Susbstitutin this back in to the equation for the energies per atom, one can see, that the FCC configuration with an approximate lattice constant of $5.7432\AA$ gives the smalles total energy and is therfore the configuration obtained.\\

Scripts used for this question:
\href{../../lattice_constant_approximation.m}{lattice\_constant\_approximation.m}


Of course, the lattice constant can also be obtained by simulations. This has been done with the input script \href{../../DIR1/in.latticeconstant}{in.latticeconstant}. To run the simulations just call \href{../../DIR1/run_latticeconstant.sh}{run\_latticeconstant.sh}.\\
The lattice-constant obtained after minimization is $5.64 \AA$. The minimization process is visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:p1_latticeconst}.

\section{Constant temperature and molecular dynamics}
Through several simulations, a timestep of $10 fs$ has been determined as stable. The inputfiles for all simulations are \href{\pathpartone/in.NVT_template}{in.NVT\_template} for the Noose-Hover thermostat and \href{\pathpartone/in.NVEBer_template}{in.NVEBer\_template} for the "weak-coupling" Berendsen thermostat.

\subsection{Equilibriation}
For the equilibriation phase, the lattice constant of $5.90 \AA$, as states on the instruction, has been used. The results are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:p1_equilibriation}. All relative variances have been calculated after the system has reached equilibrium. The plots show, that the weakly coupled Berendsen thermostat capable of delivering the exact temperature value. However, while damping helps to reduce the fluctuation in Potential energy, it increases the variance of the temperature values. For the NVT thermostat on the other hand, damping can help to reduce fluctuations in all quantities of interest.\\
Overall, the weakly-coupled Berendsen thermostat clearly performs superior compared to Nose-Hoover.

\subsection{Stability comparison between Noose-Hoover and Berendsen}
A comparison between the Nose-Hoover thermostat and the weakly-coupled Berendsed thermostat is provided in Figure~\ref{fig:p1_NVT_vs_NVEBer}.
Overall, one can say that the weakly-coupled Berendsen delivers more accurate and stable results. Also, it does not benefit from damping, on the contrary, the relative variance increases with an increasing damping parameter.

\end{figure}
\end{center}


\subsection{Dependece on the system-size}
To determine the dependence of the Nose-Hoover thermostat's convergence on the system size, simulations with a boxsize of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 have been carried out, which correlates to a total number of atoms of 500, 864, 1372, 2048, 2916, 4000, 5324 and 6912. The results are visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:p1_cellnum_study}. It can be observed, that the relative variance decays with the system size as $\frac{<T^2>-<T>^2}{<T>^2}\sim\frac{1}{N}$.

\subsection{MCMC}







\section{Constant pressure/temperature molecular dynamics}
\subsection{Finding the equilibrium box sizes}
To determine the equilbrium box sizes, a regular simulation has been conducted and the final, equilbrium average has been used as a mean value. This is viualized in Figure~\ref{fig:p1_boxsize}. By dividing the final boxlength by the original, one can obtain a scaling factor that is applied to the following simulations via the "change\_box" command(\href{\pathpartone/in.NPT_boxmod_template}{in.NPT\_boxmod\_template}).
As a verification, the box-size is again plotted over time in the right hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:p1_boxsize}.\\

In Figure~\ref{fig:pressure_over_boxsize}, the pressure distribution of the scaled simulation is plotted for different box sizes. We can clearly see a normal-like distribution centered around the target value of 1.0 atm and a shrinking variance with increasing system size.\\
The dependency of the relative variance on the number of atoms is also plotted in the bottom two figures. Clearly, the relative variance decays invers proportional with the system size.\\
 \\
From the LAMMPS manual, we can see that the pressure is computes via the formula
\begin{align}
P=\frac{N k_B T}{N}+\frac{\sum_i^{N'}r_i\cdot f_i}{dV}
\end{align}
where $N$ is the number of atoms $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the Temperature and $V$ is the control volume. The second term contains all interactions where $r_i$ and $f_i$ are the position vector if atom $i$ and dV is the change rate of the control volume. Since we are in equilibrium, the control volume remains constant, the second term can thus be neglected. Also, in the first term, $\frac{N}{V}$ is related to the density and also constant. We can therfore expect the convergence to be of the same rate as the convergence of $T$ which has already been shown in the first part to be of first order.

\subsection{Evaluation of CV}

\subsubsection{EQuilibriation}
First, the system has been equilibriated under NPT enselmble as required in the instructions. The plots, confirming that equilibrium has been reached are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p1_CV_equi_NPT}.\\
The inputfile for this task was \href{\pathpartone/in.CV_equi}{in.CV\_equi}.


\subsubsection{Estimation of box length}
The equilibrium box-length estimation under NPT ensemble in visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:p1_CV_equi_NPT_lx}. The equilibrium box length value calculates to $601~\AA$.
The inputfile for this task was \href{\pathpartone/in.CV_equi}{in.CV\_equi}.

\subsubsection{Equilibriation under NVT-ensemble}
From the previous simulations we obtain a lattice size of $54.64~\AA$, which corresponds to a scaling factor of $9.26$ w.r.t the original box length of $5.9~\AA$.\\
This scaling factor has been used in the input file for the following simulations The inputfile for this task was \href{\pathpartone/in.CV_NVT}{in.CV\_NVT}.

\subsubsection{Estimation of specific heat capacity}
The specific heat capacity $C_v=\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\right)_{V,N}$ can, according to the instruction be written as a function of the total energy variance: $C_v=\frac{<E^2>-<E>^2}{k_B*T^2}$. I, however had problems with this formula. Even a short dimension analysis doesnt't fit: $\frac{ {(kJ)}^2     }{ (\frac{kJ}{K}) {(K)}^2 } \neq \frac{kJ}{kg K}$.
However, one can also get a good approximation of $C_V$ by using a finite difference approach.
I did a central difference around $300.15~K$ with a stencil width of $1~K$ and opbtained a value of $0.1516~\frac{kJ}{kg K}$, which coincides perfectly with the literature.
The inputfiles for this task were \href{\pathpartone/in.CV_NVT_plus}{in.CV\_NVT\_plus}, postprocessing was done via \href{\pathpartone/postprocess_NVT.sh}{postprocess\_NVT.sh} and the finite difference approximation was cariied out via \href{\pathpartone/calc_CV.py}{calc\_CV.py}.









\section{Phase transition of Krypton}


For the phase transition anlaysis, simualtions between $25~K$ and $230~K$ have been cvaried out with a temperature-step of $1~K$. Each time the final configuration is written to a file and read by the subsequent simulation as a initial configuration.\\
The inputfiles are \href{\pathpartone/in.phasetrans}{in.phasetrans} for the first simulation and \href{\pathpartone/in.phasetrans_template}{in.phasetrans\_template} for all following.\\
The results are postprocessed via \href{\pathpartone/postprocess_phasetrans.py}{postprocess\_phasetrans.py} and plotted via \href{\pathpartone/plot_phasetrans.py}{plot\_phasetrans.py}.\\
For the non-dimensionalization, the equilibrium box length is read from the logfile for each temperature.

%	\dmat{\phi_k} \cdot \dvec{u_k}
%\end{align}
%
%The shape-functions $\dmat{\phi_k}$ are taken as Lagrange-polynomials based on Gauss-Lobatto points. For the purpose of this report, shape-functions up to a degree of 10 have been implemented.
%
%By inserting the above ansatz into the weak form provided in~\eqref{eq:weak_form_1D}, on can thus derive the following matrix notation:
%\begin{align}
%	\dmat{M} \dvec{\ddot{\dvec{u}}} + (-\dmat{S}+\dmat{F}) \dvec{u} & = \dmat{-F_{bound}} \dvec{h}\text{ where e.g.} \\
%	\dmat{M_{ij}}                                                   & =(\dmat{\phi_i},\dmat{\phi_j})                 
%\end{align}
%Since $\dmat{\phi_i}$ has a 2x2 matrix shape, the full $\dmat{M}$ matrix consists of diagonal 2x2 blocks assembled through the dof numbering sheme as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:dof_numbering}.
%The element matrix genaration can be formaulated in matrixform as:
%\begin{align}
%	\dmat{M_k} & =\int_{D^k} \dmat{N} \dmat{N}^T det(\dmat{J}) d\xi                                                \\
%	\dmat{S_k} & =\int_{D^k} \dmat{D} \dmat{N} \dmat{A} \dmat{N}^T \dmat{J}^{-1} det{\dmat{J}} d\xi\text{,  where} \\
%	\dmat{N}   & =

%\subsection*{F-matrix}
%The derivation of the flux-matrix $\dmat{F}$ is somewhat more difficult. We consider the last term of the wek form given in~\eqref{eq:weak_form_1D}. Clearly the resulting matrix depends on the definition of $f^*$. For this report, the Lax-Friedrichs(LF) and the  Hydrizable Discontinous Galerkin(HDG) flux were considered.
%\subsubsection{Lax-Friedrich flux}
%The Lax Friedrich flux is defined as
%\begin{align}
%	f^{*,LF}(u^+,u^-)=\frac{f(u^-)+f(u^+)}{2}+\frac{C}{2} \boldsymbol{\hat{n}}^{-} (u^- -u^+) 
%\end{align}
%where $u^-$ denotes the u value of the current element and $u^+$ denotes the $u$ value of the neigbour.
%
%The Flux matrix shall be exemplarily derived by looking at one elmenet $k$ as described in Figure~\ref{fig:ele_setup}.
%\paragraph{Left Node}
%\begin{align}
%	u^+=\left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k-1}^2 \\p_{k-1}^2 \end{array}\right),
%	u^-=\left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k}^1   \\p_{k}^1 \end{array}\right),
%	\hat{n}^{-}=-1                       
%\end{align}
%
%\begin{align}
%	f^{*,LF}(x_k) & = 
%	\frac{
%	\dmat{A_{k}}   \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k}^1\\p_{k}^1 \end{array}\right)+
%	\dmat{A_{k-1}} \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k-1}^2\\p_{k-1}^2 \end{array}\right)  
%	}{2} -
%	\frac{ 
%	C_{k}   \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k}^1\\p_{k}^1 \end{array}\right) -
%	C_{k-1} \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k-1}^2\\p_{k-1}^2 \end{array}\right) 
%	}{2} \\
%	              & = 
%	\frac{1}{2}(\dmat{A_k}-C_k\dmat{I}) \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k}^1\\p_{k}^1 \end{array}\right) +
%	\frac{1}{2}(\dmat{A_{k-1}}+C_{k-1}\dmat{I}) \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k-1}^2\\p_{k-1}^2 \end{array}\right)
%\end{align}
%
%
%
%
%\paragraph{Right Node}
%\begin{align}
%	u^+=\left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k+1}^1 \\p_{k+1}^1 \end{array}\right),
%	u^-=\left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k}^2   \\p_{k}^2 \end{array}\right),
%	\hat{n}^{-}=1                        
%\end{align}
%
%\begin{align}
%	f^{*,LF}(x_k) & = 
%	\frac{
%	\dmat{A_{k}}   \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k}^2\\p_{k}^2 \end{array}\right)+
%	\dmat{A_{k-1}} \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k+1}^1\\p_{k+1}^1 \end{array}\right)  
%	}{2} +
%	\frac{ 
%	C_{k}  \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k}^2\\p_{k}^2 \end{array}\right) -
%	C_{k-1} \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k+1}^1\\p_{k+1}^1 \end{array}\right) 
%	}{2} \\
%	              & = 
%	\frac{1}{2}(\dmat{A_k}+C_k\dmat{I})         \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k}^2\\p_{k}^2 \end{array}\right) +
%	\frac{1}{2}(\dmat{A_{k+1}}-C_{k+1}\dmat{I}) \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k+1}^1\\p_{k+1}^1 \end{array}\right)
%\end{align}
%
%
%So as a whole, for the boundary integral in Equation~\eqref{eq:weak_form_1D} the following term can be derived
%\begin{align}
%	\begin{split}
%	f^{*,LF}(x_{k+1})-f^{*,LF}(x_{k})=
%	  &   
%	\frac{1}{2}(\dmat{A_k}+C_k\dmat{I})         \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k}^2\\p_{k}^2 \end{array}\right) +
%	\frac{1}{2}(\dmat{A_{k+1}}-C_{k+1}\dmat{I}) \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k+1}^1\\p_{k+1}^1 \end{array}\right)
%	\\
%	- &   
%	\frac{1}{2}(\dmat{A_k}-C_k\dmat{I}) \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k}^1\\p_{k}^1 \end{array}\right) -
%	\frac{1}{2}(\dmat{A_{k-1}}+C_{k-1}\dmat{I}) \left(\begin{array}{c} v_{k-1}^2\\p_{k-1}^2 \end{array}\right)

%\chapter*{Tasks}
%\section*{Task1}
%The derivation of the local Lax-Friedrich flux has been carried out above.
%\section*{Task2}
%A formula for calculation of the timestep is provided in the lecture notes. Substitution, according to our Notation leads to:
%\begin{align}
%	\Delta t \leq K \frac{h}{p^2 c}\label{eq:timestep}        
%\end{align}     
%Here, K denotes a constant that is independent from the discretization. It depends only on the equation at hand, as well as the time integration method, and can thus be found easily by numerical experiments.
%\section*{Task3}
%
%The setup for task 3 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:setup3}. The simulation has been carried out with an timestep obtained by Equation~\eqref{eq:timestep}. As Figures~\ref{fig:error_development}-\ref{fig:task3_flux_comparison} show, the convergence order can be improved by using higher order polynomials, as expected. In general, the Lax-Friedrich flux deliverd slightly better results than the HDG-flux.

At the jump, one can observe, that the wave abruptly changes amplitude. This is due to the change in $\rho$. The higher $c$ in the outer domain manifests itself in the kinks at $x=\frac{1}{3}$ and $x=\frac{2}{3}$. The v-solution shows anti-symetry, whereas the p-solution is symmetric. 120 elements with a polymomial degree of 4 were used.}
